Electricity Meter Reading for Dial Display Accumulation meters

This code will allow you to run an OpenCV instance, and interpret the reading on a Dial Display Accumulation meters (example: https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Your-energy-use/Meters/Type-of-meters).

It's also an excuse for me to learn Python, so you're going to have to ignore/accept the coding practises used.
